Project Title
	A little brief about what the project is about. It should be like a small summary format informing about 
	the main purpose of the project.
Motivation
	This section is for letting the reader know why you created this project, the reason behind pursuing such
	a project, and why you have decided to do it.
Build Status
	This basically explains the current build status of the project. If there is a bug /error which needs 
	addressing. This is done so for two different reasons The user understands that this is an issue and 
	does not spend more time figuring if it was a mistake on their part. A developer who is familiar with 
	the issue can suggest some solutions directly without going through the whole code.
Features
	This is where you write what all extra features have been done in your project. Basically this is where 
	you try to make your project stand out from the rest.
API reference
	If your project is small, then we can add the reference docs in the readme. For larger projects, it is 
	better to provide links to where the API reference documentation is documented.
How to Use?
	As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide
	information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is 
	better to explain steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it.
