BINARY SEARCH TREE
	Allows the user to insert values into a binary tree structure and search, delete, and list the
	elements through various algorithms.
	
Build Status
	All of the menu options are fully functional with the exception of the nth largest element option.
	I could not figure out an algorithm to implement this successfully, so it does not work yet. Also,
	there is no way to reorganize the tree after multiple insertions and deletions.
